## 💫 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m Pratyush  

I’m a **B.E. Computer Science Engineering student** with a strong foundation in **full-stack web development** and a growing interest in **backend systems and Data Engineering**.

I build **scalable and user-focused web applications** using the **MERN stack**, with emphasis on **clean backend logic, REST APIs, and efficient data handling**. Alongside application development, I am actively transitioning toward **Data Engineering**, where I focus on **data processing, database fundamentals, data modeling, and ETL-based workflows**.
